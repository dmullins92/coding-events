# coding-events

### Project Description
coding-events is an application written with the Spring Framework and Java. It's primary purpose is to create and maintain a repository of coding events. Users can add and delete events and create categories and tags to sort their events. 

### Current State of Development
coding-events is an ongoing learning project developed with LaunchCode in St. Louis, MO. Functionality for events, event details, categories, and tags have been added along with basic views using Bootstrap. The project has also been locally connected to a MySQL database to maintain a persistent database.

### Future Development Goals
In the future, coding-events will be expanded with the ability to add users and maintain user profiles. The user class will include fields for username, name, email, password, address, and interests. Class methods will include getters/setters for each field and each user will define a one-to-many relationship with the event class.
